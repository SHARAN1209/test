ðŸ§¾ False Positive Justification â€“ SQL Injection
Finding:

SQL Injection (Path 1) â€“ jdbcTemplate.execute("TRUNCATE TABLE " + quotedTable)

SQL Injection (Path 2) â€“ jdbcTemplate.batchUpdate(insertSql, batchArgs)

Justification Summary:

This is a false positive.
The application strictly validates and sanitizes all dynamic identifiers (such as table names and column names) before they are ever used in any SQL statement.
No user-controlled data can reach the query unless it passes through this validation and metadata verification.

Detailed Explanation:

Input Validation

The variable tableName is validated using a strict regex:

private static final String IDENTIFIER_REGEX = "^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*$";


This pattern allows only letters, numbers, and underscores â€” no SQL special characters (;, ', ", --, etc.).

isValidIdentifier(tableName) ensures the name is syntactically valid before any database access.

Database Metadata Verification

After regex validation, the method tableExists(metaData, tableName) confirms that the table actually exists in the database using JDBC metadata APIs (no dynamic SQL involved in this check).

Quoting and Escaping

The table name and column names are safely quoted using the database-specific quote character obtained from:

String quote = conn.getMetaData().getIdentifierQuoteString();


This ensures that even if the table or column names contain reserved words, they are safely escaped.

No Direct Data Concatenation

All user data values are inserted using parameterized queries with ? placeholders:

jdbcTemplate.batchUpdate(insertSql, batchArgs);


There is no concatenation of user-supplied data into SQL strings.

The TRUNCATE TABLE Statement

Although TRUNCATE TABLE requires a static table name (placeholders not supported), the table name is validated and checked against the actual database metadata before execution.

Therefore, it is impossible for a malicious value to reach this query.

Controlled Code Context

The method truncateAndReloadTable is an internal service method, not directly exposed to end-users.
It is called only from trusted controller logic (uploadExcelFile) that passes validated parameters.

Security Impact:

No risk of SQL Injection.

The dynamic elements are validated, whitelisted, and verified against the database.

All data values are parameterized and never concatenated.

Recommendation for Closure:

Mark the findings as "False Positive â€“ Proper Input Validation and Metadata Verification in Place".
The implementation adheres to secure coding standards for SQL injection prevention as per OWASP and CERT guidelines.
